# Opus Nexus — Transformation Plan

## 1. Vision

Opus Nexus is the conversational command center for the Opus second brain.

Current state:

> `opus-vita` = health / workout / finance dashboard.

Target state:

> `Opus Nexus` = the daily interface where the user talks to the Opus second brain, receives briefs, gives tasks, reviews plans, approves actions, and creates calendar events.

Core promise:

> Nexus does not only display personal data. Nexus turns personal context into plans and approved actions.

Tagline:

> Talk to Nexus. Nexus talks to Opus.

Vietnamese positioning:

> Nói với Nexus. Nexus điều phối Opus.

## 2. Product Architecture

```text
OPUS
├── Nexus
│   └── Mobile/chat command center
│
├── Consilium
│   └── Decision brain / strategy memory
│
├── Animus
│   └── Agentic automation layer
│
├── Lucida
│   └── Content / production workflow
│
└── Vita
    └── Health, workout, finance, life metrics module
```

### Module meaning

- **Opus** = the whole second brain / personal operating system.
- **Nexus** = the main app shell and conversational command center.
- **Vita** = health, workout, finance, and life metrics module.
- **Consilium** = decision memory, research memory, strategy brain.
- **Animus** = automation and agent execution layer.
- **Lucida** = creation and content production workflow.

---

## 3. Rename Strategy

### Current

```text
repo/app: opus-vita
title: opus-vita
main UI: health dashboard
```

### Target

```text
app name: Opus Nexus
module name: Vita
title: Opus Nexus
primary product role: conversational command center
health/life module role: Vita
```

### Rename rule

Do not delete the Vita concept. Demote it from the whole app name to one module inside Nexus.

```text
Before:
Vita = main app

After:
Nexus = main app shell
Vita = health / workout / finance module inside Nexus
```

Example UI:

```text
🌐 Opus Nexus

Tabs:
Today | Vita | Calendar | Actions
```

MVP alternative if keeping the current tab structure temporarily:

```text
🌐 Opus Nexus
Vita · Workout · Finance
```

---

## 4. Product Level Upgrade

### Level 1 — Tracker

The app displays raw data:

```text
calories
macros
sleep
steps
weight
workout
finance
```

### Level 2 — Dashboard

The app adds:

```text
today summary
trend
progress
empty state
insight card
```

### Level 3 — Assistant

The app adds:

```text
chat / command input
daily brief
weekly review
calendar-aware advice
```

### Level 4 — Operator

The app adds:

```text
LLM proposes actions
user approves
Nexus writes approved events to Google Calendar
Nexus updates logs / reminders / plans
```

### Target for this transformation

Move from Level 1/2 to approximately Level 3.5:

```text
Dashboard + calendar-aware planning + approved calendar actions
```

Do not implement full autonomous agent behavior yet.

---

## 5. Core Features After Transformation

## Feature A — Nexus Today

### Purpose

The Today screen should answer within 5 seconds:

```text
What should I pay attention to today?
What is on my calendar?
How is my health/life status?
What action should I take next?
```

### UI concept

```text
🌐 Opus Nexus

Today Brief
- key calendar events
- health status
- workout suggestion
- meal suggestion
- one recommended action

Vita Snapshot
- kcal
- protein
- sleep
- steps

Calendar Snapshot
- busy level
- eating-out risk
- workout window

Action Queue
- approve weekly plan
- add workout to calendar
- review finance
```

---

## Feature B — Vita Module

Vita is the health/life data module preserved from `opus-vita`.

### Includes

```text
Health
Workout
Finance
Meal logs
Sleep
Steps
Weight
Weekly trend
```

### Required improvements

```text
1. Fix schema compatibility.
2. Add design tokens.
3. Add progress rings.
4. Add insight cards.
5. Improve empty states.
6. Keep GitHub personal data store.
```

### Role

Vita becomes the personal life data layer for Nexus, not the full app identity.

---

## Feature C — Calendar Context

Nexus reads Google Calendar to understand the user's week.

### What it reads

```text
upcoming events
busy days
free windows
late meetings
eating-out events
travel
gym / workout blocks
```

### OAuth scope for read

```text
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly
```

### Output

```text
Calendar Context Card

This week:
- Monday and Wednesday are high-busy days.
- Friday has eating-out risk.
- Tuesday 19:00 is a good workout window.
- Sunday is suitable for meal prep or weekly review.
```

Calendar data should not be stored in GitHub by default during MVP. Read it directly, summarize it in memory, and use it for planning.

---

## Feature D — Calendar Action Assistant

Nexus can create Google Calendar events from LLM proposals after user approval.

### Safe flow

```text
User intent
→ Nexus reads context
→ LLM creates event proposals as JSON
→ Nexus previews proposals
→ User approves selected events
→ Nexus inserts approved events into Google Calendar
```

### OAuth scope for write

```text
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
```

### Important control rule

```text
LLM must not write directly to Google Calendar.
LLM only creates proposal JSON.
User must approve.
The app calls Google Calendar API only after approval.
```

### Example

User:

```text
Tuần này sắp cho tôi 3 buổi tập, tránh ngày meeting tối.
```

Nexus proposal:

```text
Tue 19:00 — Strength training
Thu 20:30 — Light walk
Sun 17:00 — Meal prep
```

User action:

```text
[Add selected to Calendar]
```

---

## Feature E — Plan My Week

This should be the first flagship feature of Opus Nexus.

### Flow

```text
1. User taps “✨ Plan My Week”.
2. Nexus reads:
   - calendar for the next 7–14 days
   - health logs
   - workout logs
   - finance / eating signals
   - user goals and preferences
3. Nexus creates a weekly plan:
   - workout events
   - walk / micro-action events
   - meal prep
   - sleep protection
   - weekly review
4. User approves selected actions.
5. Nexus adds approved events to Google Calendar.
```

### Example output

```text
Nexus đề xuất tuần này:

1. Tue 19:00 — Strength training
   Reason: evening is free, and there has been no workout for 2 days.

2. Fri lunch — Light meal guardrail
   Reason: dinner outside is scheduled that evening.

3. Sun 17:00 — Meal prep
   Reason: reduce convenience-food risk next week.

4. Sun 20:00 — Weekly review
   Reason: review health, workout, finance, and schedule.
```

---

## Feature F — Daily Brief

Generated when the user opens the app, not necessarily as a push notification in MVP.

Example:

```text
Good morning.

Today:
- Calendar is busy from 10:00–17:00.
- Dinner outside is scheduled tonight.
- Yesterday's protein was low.
- Sleep is good: 7.5h.

Suggested actions:
- Keep lunch lighter and protein-focused.
- Avoid heavy training today.
- Walk 10 minutes after dinner.
```

---

## Feature G — Weekly Review

At the end of the week, Nexus summarizes life operation signals.

Example:

```text
This week:
- Workout: 2 sessions.
- Sleep: average 7.1h.
- Protein: below target on 4/7 days.
- Eating out: 3 times.
- Food spending increased.

Suggestion for next week:
- 2 strength sessions.
- 3 walking blocks.
- 1 meal prep block.
- 2 sleep-protection events on high-busy days.
```

The weekly review should be convertible into a calendar proposal.

---

## 6. Data Architecture

## Existing data folders

```text
health-data/
workout-data/
finance-data/
```

## New data folders to consider

```text
user-profile/
  goals.json
  preferences.json
  constraints.json

nexus-plans/
  index.json
  2026-W22.json

nexus-actions/
  index.json
  2026-05-29.json
```

Calendar events should not be stored in GitHub by default during MVP.

---

## 7. User Profile Schema

```json
{
  "goals": [
    {
      "id": "fat_loss",
      "label": "Giảm cân nhẹ",
      "priority": "high",
      "target": "Giảm 2kg trong 8 tuần"
    },
    {

  "constraints": {
    "no_calendar_auto_write": true,
    "approval_required": true,
    "busy_days_need_micro_actions": true
  }
}
```

---

## 8. LLM Proposal Schema

Nexus should require LLM output as JSON only.

```json
{
  "summary": "Tuần này nên ưu tiên tập đều, tăng protein và bảo vệ giấc ngủ.",
  "events": [
    {
      "title": "Strength training",
      "type": "workout",
      "start": "2026-06-02T19:00:00+09:00",
      "end": "2026-06-02T19:45:00+09:00",
      "location": "Gym",
      "description": "Focus: strength session. Reason: evening is free and previous workout was 2+ days ago.",
      "reminders": [
        {
          "method": "popup",
          "minutes": 30
        }
      ],
      "confidence": "high",
      "reason": "Free evening slot and good recovery window."
    }
  ],
  "micro_actions": [
    {
      "date": "2026-06-04",
      "title": "Walk after dinner",
      "reason": "Busy day with low workout probability."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 9. Validation Rules

Before showing or approving a proposal, validate:

```text
- title required
- start required
- end required
- start < end
- no overlap with existing calendar events
- duration <= 3h unless special type
- type must be allowed
- timezone should be Asia/Tokyo by default
```

Allowed event types:

```text
workout
walk
meal_prep
sleep_protection
hydration
recovery
weekly_review
deep_work
study
personal_admin
```

---

## 10. Google Calendar Integration

### Read events

Use:

```text
calendar.events.list
calendarId: primary
timeMin: now
timeMax: now + 14 days
singleEvents: true
orderBy: startTime
```

### Write approved events

Use:

```text
calendar.events.insert
calendarId: primary
sendUpdates: none
```

### Add source marker

Every Nexus-created event should include:

```js
extendedProperties: {
  private: {
    source: "opus-nexus",
    type: proposal.type
  }
}
```

This enables future filtering or editing of only Nexus-created events.

## 16. Claude / Codex Planning Prompt

Use this prompt to ask Claude or Codex to create a code implementation plan.

```md
# Task: Transform opus-vita into Opus Nexus

## Context
`opus-vita` is currently a single-file mobile-first dashboard in `index.html`.
It reads health/workout/finance data from GitHub via PAT.

The product direction is changing:

- Old: opus-vita = health/life tracker
- New: Opus Nexus = conversational command center for the Opus second brain
- Vita remains as a health/life metrics module inside Nexus

## Goal
Create a concrete code implementation plan before editing code.

## Product Architecture
OPUS:
- Nexus = mobile/chat command center
- Vita = health/workout/finance/life metrics
- Consilium = decision brain
- Animus = automation layer
- Lucida = content workflow

## Required Phase 0
Stabilize current Vita:
1. Fix schema compatibility for health data:
   - support both `grams` and `amount_g`
   - support both `protein` and `protein_g`
   - support both `total_protein` and `total_protein_g`
2. Fix zero/empty states:
   - water_ml: 0 => chưa log
   - steps: 0 => chưa log
   - weight_kg: 0 => chưa log
3. Add console warnings for non-canonical schema.

## Required Phase 1
Rename shell to Opus Nexus:
1. Change document title to `Opus Nexus`.
2. Change topbar branding to `🌐 Opus Nexus`.
3. Treat existing health/workout/finance area as the `Vita` module.
4. Add a simple Today/Nexus summary section above existing Vita dashboard.
5. Do not remove current Health / Workout / Finance features.

## Required Phase 2
Add design system primitives:
1. Semantic CSS tokens for Nexus/Vita.
2. Reusable card classes.
3. Add helper render functions:
   - renderInsightCard()
   - renderMetricHeroCard()
   - renderProposalCard()
   - renderEmptyMetric()
4. Keep app as single `index.html`.

## Required Phase 3
Add Google Calendar read integration:
1. Add Google Calendar config constants:
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   - GOOGLE_API_KEY
   - CALENDAR_DISCOVERY_DOC
   - CALENDAR_SCOPES
2. Use Google Identity Services.
3. Use read scope:
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
4. Add Connect Calendar button.
5. Load upcoming 14 days from primary calendar.
6. Summarize calendar:
   - busy level
   - eating-out risk
   - late-event risk
   - possible free windows
7. Render Calendar Context card.
8. If calendar is not connected, app must still work normally.

## Required Phase 4
Add calendar proposal approval flow:
1. Add proposal JSON paste area.
2. Parse and validate event proposal JSON.
3. Show event proposal preview cards.
4. Add approval selection.
5. For write action, use scope:
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
6. Insert approved events using Google Calendar `events.insert`.
7. Add:
   extendedProperties.private.source = "opus-nexus"
8. Never auto-create events without user approval.

## LLM Event Proposal Schema
{
  "summary": "",
  "events": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "type": "workout|walk|meal_prep|sleep_protection|hydration|recovery|weekly_review|deep_work|study|personal_admin",
      "start": "2026-06-02T19:00:00+09:00",
      "end": "2026-06-02T19:45:00+09:00",
      "location": "",
      "description": "",
      "reminders": [
        { "method": "popup", "minutes": 30 }
      ],
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "reason": ""
    }
  ]
}

## Validation Rules
- title required
- start required
- end required
- start < end
- no overlap with existing calendar events
- duration <= 3h unless type is sleep_protection
- type must be allowed
- timezone should be Asia/Tokyo by default

## Non-goals
- Do not add backend.
- Do not migrate to React.
- Do not remove GitHub PAT data loading.
- Do not store calendar events in GitHub.
- Do not auto-write to Calendar.
- Do not add medical checkup feature in this phase.
- Do not implement OCR.
- Do not add autonomous agent behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Existing health/workout/finance dashboard still works.
- App branding is Opus Nexus.
- Vita is treated as a module inside Nexus.
- Calendar can be connected read-only.
- Calendar context can be displayed.
- User can paste LLM proposal JSON.
- Proposal is validated and previewed.
- User can approve selected events.
- Approved events are added to Google Calendar.
- App still runs as a single `index.html`.

Return:
1. implementation phases
2. exact files to edit
3. functions to add/change
4. risk list
5. test checklist
6. minimal first PR scope
```

---

## 17. Strategic Summary

```text
Opus Nexus is the new product shell.
Vita becomes the health/life module.
Calendar becomes the execution layer.
Consilium becomes the decision memory.
LLM becomes the planner.
User approval remains the control gate.
```

Best first flagship feature:

```text
✨ Plan My Week
```

Because it proves the full product loop:

```text
Second brain understands context
→ LLM creates plan
→ Nexus previews
→ user approves
→ Calendar executes
```
